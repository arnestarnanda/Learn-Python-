# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. 
Machine Learning, a set of Algorithms, gives Machines or Computers the ability to learn from data on their own without any human intervention.

# Machine Learning in Data Science
Machine Learning analyzes large chunks of data automatically. Machine Learning basically automates the process of Data Analysis and makes data-informed predictions in real-time without any human intervention. 
A Data Model is built automatically and further trained to make real-time predictions. 
This is where the Machine Learning Algorithms are used in the Data Science Lifecycle.

# Machine Learning Workflow
In doing machine learning we need the stages as below:
* Data Profiling
* Data Cleansing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Pre Processing Modeling
* Modeling
* Evaluate Modeling

# Modeling Workflow




# Time Series
Time series forecasting is basically the machine learning modeling for Time Series data (years, days, hours, etc.)for predicting future values using Time Series modeling .This helps if your data in serially correlated.

Time series forecasting is the task of predicting future values based on historical data.
