# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. 
Machine Learning, a set of Algorithms, gives Machines or Computers the ability to learn from data on their own without any human intervention.

# Machine Learning in Data Science
Machine Learning analyzes large chunks of data automatically. Machine Learning basically automates the process of Data Analysis and makes data-informed predictions in real-time without any human intervention. 
A Data Model is built automatically and further trained to make real-time predictions. 
This is where the Machine Learning Algorithms are used in the Data Science Lifecycle.

# Machine Learning Workflow
In doing machine learning we need the stages as below:
* Data Profiling
* Data Cleansing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Pre Processing Modeling
* Modeling
* Evaluate Modeling
