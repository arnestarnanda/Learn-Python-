# Library
## Math Library
Python has a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

some of the function that can be used from the math library:
* ### pi, The math.pi method return 3.14(pi) value.
* ### ceil, The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer.
* ### floor, The math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer.
* ### sqrt, The math.sqrt() method returns the square root of a number.

## Datetime Library
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

the notebook contains:
* ### get current time with today(),
* ### formatting with strftime().

## IO Library
The io module provides Python’s main facilities for dealing with various types of I/O.

This module is a part of the standard library, so there’s no need to install it separately using pip.

## Sys Library
The python sys module provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate different parts of the Python Runtime Environment. It lets us access system-specific parameters and functions.

## Numpy Library
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
